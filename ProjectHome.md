**QuiteSleep** is an application for Android 2.0+ which manages your incoming calls when you're busy, sleeping, or doing anything between two time slots in any day of the week. QuiteSleep can block a list of callers or even other different incoming calls and send an SMS or e-mail with a predefined text to notify you're busy, sleeping, etc.

**QuiteSleep** will make your rest much better without worry of your phone disturb you.

**The new QuiteSleep 3.0 has a completely new interaction following the latest uxd design patterns started since Android 3.0 as ActionBar (native) and ViewPager, and using fragments, customized buttons, etc.**

QuiteSleep (v2.0) includes more and great functionality like:

Adapted to Android 2.2 (Froyo), now you can put QuiteSleep into SDcard.

Four different ways to allow who can call you, this include:
  1. block all.
  1. block only blocked contacts.
  1. block unknown
  1. block unknown and blocked contacts.

This new features are request to many people who have contacted to me.

Two different ways to block an incoming call:
  1. Block by silent the incoming call (the previous and unique way in QuiteSleep 1.xx).
  1. Block by hang up the incoming call (this feature has been tested in Android 2.0 to 2.2 with good results).

Fixed some bugs.

Improve SMS sending task (now with Android SMS fix, it runs well).

And other changes.

Beta v1.1 is already released in Android Market, and there are updated the code
in the Mercurial repository, tarball package, api doc, and ready for install Android .apk

Bugs fixed:

1- Fixed a problem which the application died internally and produced malfunction. QuiteSleep now runs much better (very much).

2- Fixed send SMS messages, note that the history shows the sms shipment try,
not indicates if the shipment/delivery was right.

3- Fixed several internal functions like thread and services uses.

Important Note: not is a bug, but depends on your mobile activity, a blocked
incoming call could be sound < 1 second, and then pass to silent mode. Not is
QuiteSleep faults, is due, as I say, to the mobile activity.
